"""EVALUATION OF NATURALNESS

This code can be used to evaluate the naturalness of output sentiment texts of examined style transfer models.

For a baseline understanding of what is considered "natural," any method used for automated evaluation of naturalness 
also requires an understanding of the human-sourced input texts. 

Inspired by the adversarial evaluation approach in "Generating Sentences from a Continuous Space"
(Bowman et al., 2016), we trained unigram logistic regression classifiers and LSTM logistic regression classifiers 
on samples of input texts and output texts for each style transfer model.

Via adversarial evaluation, the classifiers must distinguish human-generated inputs from machine-generated outputs. 
The more natural an output is, the likelier it is to fool an adversarial classifier.

We calculate percent agreement with human judgments. Both classifiers show greater agreement on which texts are
considered more natural with humans given relative scoring tasks than with those given absolute scoring tasks.

Usage:
    - View percent agreement between automated scores and human scores              -> display_agreements()
    - Calculate naturalness scores for texts with clf, a NaturalnessClassifier      -> clf.score(...)

You can find examples of more detailed usage commands below.
