I'll give him some liquor .,He shall taste of my bottle .
"If he's never drunk it before , it'll help soothe his fever .","If he have never drunk wine afore , it will go near to remove his fit ."
"If I can tame him , I'll charge as much as I can get for him .","If I can recover him and keep him tame , I will not take too much for him ."
"He'll bring a lot of money to the person who owns him , that's for sure .","He shall pay for him that hath him , and that soundly ."
