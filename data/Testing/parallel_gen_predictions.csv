293,"I am done in this world, I believe."
294,May a plague strike both your houses.
295,"I can not think that dog, that rat, that mouse, that cat could scratch me to death!"
296,", that braggart, punk villain that fights like he learned swordsmanship by manual!"
297,Upon what means came you in between us?
298,he struck me under your arm.
299,'tis the right.

329,"cries out, ""Stop, my friends."
330,"'tis."" Then he leapped in between them And forced them to put their swords down."
331,"ere I might break the fray, Tybalt was killed."
332,Romeo fled When Tybalt fell dead.
333,Benvolio is a son of the Montague.
334,he tells not the truth.
335,"twenty Montagues fighting in this choleric riot, And together these twenty could kill one man."
336,"thou, Prince, is he that can give me justice."
337,Romeo killed Tybalt.
338,he dies.
339,Romeo killed Tybalt.
340,Upon what price shall Mercutio lose his life?

343,Brutus shall bear such harsh punishments as this.
344,thy pleas and excuses I will not hear.

351,", come."
352,", come, Romeo."
353,thou art whiter than snow on the raven's wings.

360,", lady, we are all spoiled!"
361,A most unhappy day!
362,", can God be so full of jealousy and hateful?"
363,", though God be not so, Romeo is hateful."
364,Upon what kind of devil art thou to torture me thus?
365,'tis as foul As the tortures of hell.
366,hath Romeo killed himself?
367,"'T is but ""Ay"" and I will turn more poisonous than the worm with the foul eye."

381,he's a raven with the dove's feathers.
382,"Upon nature, what didst thou in hell?"
383,e'er there was such a villainy in a book with so fair a cover?
384,", where's my servant?, Give me some brandy., These griefs, these pains, these sorrows, These sorrows make me old."
385,Shame on Romeo!
386,I hope sores cover thy tongue for such a wish!
387,he was not porn to shame.
388,"he is of only honor, full of perfect honor."
389,"O, I was such a beast to be angry with him."
390,shalt thou praise him that killed thy cousin?
391,"Upon what cause, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?"
392,Probably for the villainy that killed my husband.
393,'tis comforting news.
394,Upon what cause should I weep?
395,"I would be glad to forget it, but yet it weighs in my memory As sins linger in our guilty minds."

422,tidings can not be kept secretly from the Prince's punishment.
423,", is the Prince's punishment any less monstrous than doomsday?"
424,"Ha, banishment?"
425,"Be merciful and say ""death."" Exile is much worse than death."
426,"Say not ""banishment."" From henceforth thou art banished from old Verona."
427,the world is broad and wide.

429,"To be banished from Verona is to be banished from the world, and banished from the world is death."
430,call death banishment is to cut off my head with a golden ax And smiling when I am murdered.
431,O deadly sin!

433,"'tis torture, not mercy."
434,"Yea, more honorable, better suited to romance than Romeo."
435,"Flies can kiss her, but I must fly from the city."
436,"Flies are free men, but I am banished."
437,'Tis not death to be banished?
438,"thou hadst no poison, no sharp knife, no weapon that thou couldst use To kill me at hand, nothing so disgraceful, but banishment?"
439,"o Friar, damned souls use the word banishment To describe hell."
440,They howl at banishment.
441,"if thou beest a member Of a divine synod of men Who forgive sins, How canst thou mangle me with the word banishment?"
442,"thou foolish madman, hear me speak."
443,"ere I came hither, Your servants did fight with your enemy's servants."
444,I did draw my sword to part them.
445,", as we did exchange blows, More and more people came to take part in the fray, Till the Prince come and broke all of us."
446,", where's Romeo?"
447,", hast thou seen him today?"
448,he was not here for this fray.
449,"Upon him I went, but he saw me coming And lodged himself in the woods."
450,"he hath seen many mornings, tears that add to the morning dew And making a cloudier day With his sighs."

452,", you'll speak yet again of banishment."
453,utter nothing else.
454,", so madmen as you are deaf."

459,rise.
460,'tis knocking.
461,", good Romeo, hide yourself."
462,Unless all the mist that I have of my heart's groans Covers me like fog And conceals me from the eyes of search-seeing men.

464,wilt thou come?
465,wilt thou do?
466,", holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar, where is my lady's husband?"
467,", where's Romeo?"
468,"he doth play the role of Juliet, like her."

1452,", therefore, that you are so waked That tells me you have been moved With some fear."
1453,"'tis not so, but this is the answer : You, Romeo, have not been to bed tonight."
